# MLBTeamPredictor
Predicts how well an MLB team will do in upcoming seasons based on previous data and utilizing the most important features of the data.

Most important features were found based on strength of correlation to the total number of wins.
These features were then used in both a multiple regression and a K-Nearest Neighbors analysis.
The final year of the dataset was used to test the accuracy of the model, and results were visualized with a bar chart and histogram.

Folder titled 'original' contains all of the data taken from the Sean Lehmans Baseball Database
